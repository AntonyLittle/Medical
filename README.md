# Medical Imaging Example Application - Antony Little

This is a lightweight demo of a medical imaging app, making use of Bootstrap, JQuery and Knockout to provide an AJAX-based MVVM single-page application.
It has been written in about 12 hours in total, and is intended to show a basic grasp of the concepts involved.

KNOWN ISSUES:
	* Loading volumes is <i>very</i> slow - it's using JSON to serialise volume data. This is obviously wrong(!) and is next up to be amended, but remains as is due to time constraints.
	* There's something not quite right with Wl/WW - it seems to be 'jumping'.
